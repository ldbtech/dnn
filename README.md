# Deep Neural Network 
This code is based on certaficate I am working on now from Coursera.com. Professor. Andrew Ng <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?">(Deep Learning Specialization)</a>. 

# Intention: 
I am intending of building organized code or Library you can say that starts from Linear Regression to Convolutional Neural network without using any library other than Numpy and Pandas and other visualization libraries but No Tensorflow or Keras.
At the same time, I am intending to develop libray I will be building base on research papers I will reading and might add other algorithms that can be used for CNN and RNN. 


# How this is going to be done?! 

You might have a question about why I am doing this?! . I believe the best way of learning is finding alternative ways of doing something in this case DL. 
Prof. Andrew Ng, certaficate on DL will teach me somethings I can use in the future. But my goal is develp tools and find a way to do it much easily and faster. 
Since, I have background in CS and Math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probabilities) . I say why not develop library while learning DL that will teach me the limit of DL and try to surpass that limit and be passionate about it as well. 

# Updating Every Month

This Document will keep updating every Month about the things I WILL BE ADDING SO KEEP ON EYE ON THAT.
